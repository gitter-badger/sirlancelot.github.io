I've frequently wanted to figure out if the time I spent filling out a form to
receive a reimbursement was really worth the money. Companies offer all kinds of
reimbursements, I wanted to see if the money I get back was really worth the
time I spent going their hoops.

Obviously, this can be solved with a little math. Since everyone hates doing
that, I created a little formula since you're too lazy to do it yourself.
